# Debts Tracker API

Personally, I faced so much problems in the past as I would often forget how much exactly people owe me, when they took it, reason they did, and usually how much I'm being owed. Same applies to others.

And due to this, I have lost reasonable amounts bcuz I forgot and my debtors didn't comply. 
And same with when I'm owing, I have got to pay fines several times bcuz I forgot to comply on time.

An application that manages your debts, by keeping a record of how much people owe you, tracking exactly the following;
- time, amount, name of person, active phone number. Reasons, note, and also the percentage of interest if specified.

And also, you can store record detail for how much you owe another person.
Recording thesame details as specified up.

The on the app, it should be able to signal the debtors based on a specified date to remind the person of the payment contract. 

And also, possibility to pay directly to the people you owe, when issued a command with the amount to be paid through mobile money. 

Also it should indicate, the due date to you if you are owing someone too, by an sms. And indicating on the app. 

Extra point 
Could connect the debtor with the debtee together in one place. If they both have the application installed in their devices.
